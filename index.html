<!-- 
 (not so) Quick note: all code for this website was written fully by me, an HTML/CSS hobbyist, unless explicity marked otherwise. 
 I wanted to clarify this since the milestone rubric has a section for building on top of AI-generated content. 
 I'm fairly confident that my code is clearly human, but wanted to say this just in case.
 Okay soapbox over, check out my website :)
